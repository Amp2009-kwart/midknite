  ALL ABOUT TOPOLOGIES, NODES, PROTOCOLS, etc.


  A computer network is a system of two or more interconnected devices (like computers, printers, servers) that share data, resources, and services, 
  using physical cables or wireless signals, with protocols like TCP/IP governing communication, enabling functions from sending emails to global 
  internet access, ranging from home LANs to the vast Internet. Networks use a complex set of rules/protocols that determine how data/information is 
  transmitted over the network.


Key Components

   * Nodes: Devices on the network (computers, phones, printers, routers).
   * Links/Media: The connection path (Ethernet cables, fiber optics, Wi-Fi).
   * Protocols: Rules for data exchange (TCP/IP, HTTP).
   * Hardware: Routers, switches, cables.
