  THIS PAGE IS ALL ABOUT QUANTUM COMPUTING
</h1>


<p>
  Quantum computing is an advanced field using quantum mechanics (superposition, entanglement) to build computers that solve complex problems classical computers can't,
  leveraging qubits (quantum bits) to exist in multiple states (0 and 1) simultaneously, enabling massive parallel computation for tasks like drug discovery, material science, AI, 
  and breaking modern encryption, though still an emerging technology facing challenges like stability and scalability.
